## Course Overview

An intro to Node.js via a set of self-guided mini-projects from the command-line.

### About This Course

  Welcome to the Node Academy, where you're going to learn to build applications in raw Node.js with no frameworks, and no external libraries. And yes, that means no NPM!

### Who This Course Is For

  Any engineer who wants to:
  
- gain a deeper understanding of the Node API
- write their Node.js framework
- author their useful Node.js modules
- be able to fix Node.js libraries when they break and submit pull requests to your favorite Node.js projects to make them faster and more secure
  
### Course Prerequisites

- A beginner audience who is hearing about your topic for the first time
  - The audience has the requisite knowledge as you would typically expect for your topic
  - You should be comfortable in your terminal (shell) and have admin (sudo) privileges on your workstation.
  - Experience in NodeJS is not required but recommended.
  - Download the latest version of node Node version 8.x.x LTS
  - Text-editor (VSCode or Sublime)
  - Source Code from Github

## Anatomy Of A Node App

### What is Node

A conceptual overview of Node.js. What Node is, what V8 is, and how they both work, as well as how they relate to each other.

### Common Node conventions

We'll talk about a few standard conventions used with Node.js, as well as the differences between writing javascript for Node.js and writing it for the browser.

### Interactive Quiz

## Build a Dad Jokes Generator CLI
Now we're going to build a Node.js CLI App that randomizes a set of corny dad jokes from a text file `jokes.txt`. Doing this exercise will familiarize yourself with several key sections of the Node.js docs:

- `"fs"`, the file system,
- `lib`,
- `string decoder`, and
- `path`

### Filesystem structure

Our filesystem structure will look like this:

### Setup

### Basic Scaffolding

- [**Resource:**](#) markdown guide with step-by-step instructions

Our project will contain the following files:

![directory-tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredsiika/node-academy/master/Section-1/directory-tree.png)

We'll go through each file one by one to understand how they relate to each other.

## Test the CLI
Now that we've gone through all the files that make up the project, it's time to test our CLI app.

## Source code
Link to final source code on GitHub will be provided.

## Final Review
Conclusion of the project, as well as any relevant applications to this project.

## Further Reading
Additional links and resources the audience will find useful.
